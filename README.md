# Sheets ‚Üí German TTS Podcast

Generate short German-learning audio ‚Äúmini-lessons‚Äù straight from Google Sheets.

The workflow:
1) Read a **named range** (English, German word, German sentence) selected via `Dashboard!E5`.
2) For each row, synthesize speech:
   - English text (en-US)
   - German word (de-DE)
   - German sentence (de-DE)
3) Merge each row‚Äôs clips (EN ‚Üí word ‚Üí sentence), then concatenate all rows into one MP3.
4) Save `<tableName>.mp3` to Google Drive.

Optional helper: auto-fill missing German example sentences for a list of words using OpenAI.
